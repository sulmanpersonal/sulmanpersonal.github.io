            <hr/>
            <strong>BALANCEBOT(Two wheel self-balancing Robot)</strong><br/>
            My Bachelor Degree final year project is BALANCE BOT; it is a robot that balances itself at two wheels. It comprises of PD PWM controller design for controlling speed of motors depending upon the tilt measured by IMU sensor. We used STM32F103RB. Government of Pakistan National ICT R&amp;D has funded this project completely. (<a href="www.ictrdf.org.pk" target="_blank">National ICT R&amp;D</a>)<br/><br/>

            <strong>Android App Development</strong><br/>
            I made apps for android and home, industrial and poultry automation using sms. The apps receive sms and sends sms of codes from automation devices and put them in friendly display. Also makes a database of that sms also make log file of sms. I also uploaded apps on play store. (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sulman+Baig" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>)<br/><br/>

            <strong>Position Control of single phase AC induction motor</strong><br/>
            In electric machines course, I designed a position control for single phase AC induction motor for precise controlling of motor to stop at some point. This project has vast applications in PLC and digital control systems for controlling motors on conveyer belts.<br/><br/>

            <strong>CUBLAS implementation using CUDA C in GPU</strong><br/>
            In Programming Massively Parallel Processors we designed a project of implementing CUBLAS in GPU using CUDA C for faster computation of linear algebra computations.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Building a search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo</strong><br/>
            In my Independent course work I studied how to build my own search engine as Google or DuckduckGo. How to design web crawler and preventing from spams, also how to rank the best page as Google or other search engines do.<br/><br/>

            <strong>RFID based home security system with pre-emptive RTOS</strong><br/>
            My embedded system design project was RFID tag based home security system over STM32 with ChibiOS RTOS of characteristic pre-emption was used to design the project. It also includes the secured encoded data transfer to computer for more easy access to door.

            <strong>Digital electromagnetic flow meter</strong><br/>
            In my instrumentation subject I designed flow meter to measure flow of water through a pipe which had two coils outside to make electric field. The faster the water flows the more electric field is disturbed and less voltage are measured in the electrodes. I used PIC18F452 to make the meter digital and show flow rate on LCD.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Wireless DC motor speed control</strong><br/>
            This was my communication systems project of simplex mode of wireless communication. It communicates at 433MHz frequency with OOK modulation. One controller sends encoded message for key pressed and other controller controls motor speed accordingly.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Simulation of Doppler effect in RADAR</strong><br/>
            In Digital signal processing I designed MATLAB routine to determine the doppler shift in RADAR for moving object. The signals of RADAR are given as input from DSP kit to microphone of computer and that sound signals delay are calculated as doppler shift.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Home automation using SMS</strong><br/>
            In Embedded systems, I designed project for controlling lights and fans of home using SMS. I used Sony Ericsson T290i mobile using AT commands. The controller reads the SMS received by mobile and the operation in SMS is taken and then controller sends SMS to party for confirmation.
